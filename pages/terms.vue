        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>These booking conditions form the basis of your contract with ("we", "us", and "our"). Please review them
            carefully as they outline our respective rights and obligations. By requesting us to confirm your booking,
            you are deemed to have read and agreed to these conditions.</p>
        <p>These booking conditions apply solely to the trip arrangements you book with us in Rwanda, which we agree to
            make, provide, or perform (as applicable) under our contract with you. References to "trip", "booking",
            "contract", or "arrangements" pertain to these trip arrangements unless stated otherwise. References to
            "departure" denote the start date of these arrangements.</p>
        <h3>Booking Your Trip and Payment Details</h3>
        <p><strong>Booking Procedure:</strong> To make a booking, please follow the procedure outlined on our website or
            request an offline application form. Each traveller must complete the relevant form. If you are under 18 at
            the time of booking, the form must be signed by your parent or guardian or initiated online during the
            booking process. Submit the completed booking form along with the payments specified below.</p>
        <p>If we have confirmed the availability of your chosen arrangements and you book within the applicable time
            frame, your booking is considered firm, and a contract between us will be established upon receipt of your
            completed application form and deposit. We will send a receipt for all payments and an invoice. If
            availability has not been confirmed, the contract will be established upon dispatch of our invoice. For
            bookings made through our website without prior confirmation, any electronic acknowledgment is not a
            confirmation of the booking. Verify your invoice upon receipt and contact us immediately if any information
            is incorrect or incomplete.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment Details:</strong> A minimum deposit of $100.00 or full payment when the tour cost is less
            than $300. We also offer an instalment plan where 50% of the trip payment is due at least 3 months before
            departure. The full balance must be received by us no later than six weeks prior to departure. Bookings made
            within six weeks of departure require immediate full payment.</p>
        <p>If the balance (including any applicable surcharge) is not received by the due date, we reserve the right to
            treat the booking as cancelled by you. If we do not cancel immediately due to a payment promise, you must
            pay the cancellation charges as outlined in paragraph 7 based on when we reasonably treat your booking as
            cancelled.</p>
        <h3>Price and Changes</h3>
        <p>The quoted price covers the cost of planning, organizing, and executing the trip, including group equipment,
            supplies, accommodation, administration, and staff. You are responsible for additional costs such as
            vaccination fees, travel insurance, travel to/from the start/return point, international flights, passport
            and visa costs, personal equipment, and personal expenses not specifically included in the trip description
            or invoice.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to amend and correct errors in quoted prices before your trip is confirmed. We will
            notify you of any such errors and the applicable price at the time of booking.</p>
        <p>After confirmation, the price may be adjusted due to changes in transportation costs, dues, taxes, fees, or
            exchange rates used in calculating your trip cost. Any surcharge or refund will be based on these changes.
            If a surcharge exceeds 10% of the trip cost, you may cancel your booking and receive a full refund of all
            monies paid or purchase an alternative trip as described in paragraph 12.</p>
        <h3>Travel Insurance</h3>
        <p>It is essential to have adequate travel insurance for your trip, including coverage for adventurous
            activities such as trekking at altitude. Ensure your policy covers cancellation costs from the booking date
            and medical expenses, including evacuation and repatriation.</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>By booking, you confirm you are in good health, physically capable of undertaking all aspects of the trip,
            and unaware of any condition that may affect your suitability to participate or risk of illness or injury.
            If you have any medical condition or disability that may impact your trip, contact us before submitting your
            application form for assistance in assessing the trip's suitability for you.</p>
        <p>If information on your application form or medical questionnaire is found to be materially incorrect or
            incomplete, we reserve the right to cancel your booking or terminate your participation, with cancellation
            charges as specified in paragraph 7.</p>
        <h3>Special Requests</h3>
        <p>Notify us of any special requests prior to booking. While we will strive to accommodate such requests,
            confirmation of a special request does not guarantee fulfillment. Obtain written confirmation where
            important to you.</p>
        <h3>Cancellations and Changes</h3>
        <p><strong>Cancellation Charges:</strong>12 weeks or more before departure: $100.00 per person. 12 to 6 weeks
            before departure: 25% of the total cost. 6 to 2 weeks before departure: 50% of the total cost. 2 weeks or
            less before departure: 100% of the total cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Insurance Claims:</strong> Depending on the reason for cancellation, you may be able to reclaim
            charges under your insurance policy. Claims should be made directly to the insurer. For partial
            cancellations affecting the trip's price basis, we will recalculate and re-invoice accordingly.</p>
        <p><strong>Transfer of Booking:</strong> You may transfer your place to another person (introduced by you) if
            you are unable to travel, provided we are notified at least 2 weeks before departure. All associated costs
            and any overdue balance must be settled before the transfer.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to Confirmed Trips:</strong> Changes can be considered based on practicality and
            availability, but may incur additional costs. We do not charge an amendment fee but will pass on extra costs
            from suppliers. Changes may result in recalculating the holiday price. A change of dates will be treated as
            a cancellation and rebooking, subject to cancellation charges.</p>
        <p><strong>Itinerary Changes:</strong> The itinerary is a guide and may be altered due to circumstances beyond
            our control, such as adverse weather or force majeure. We will attempt to maintain the content of the
            itinerary as reasonably possible. Additional costs due to weather conditions will be mutually agreed upon.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Changes and Cancellations by Us:</strong> We reserve the right to make changes to and correct errors
            in advertised details and cancel bookings if necessary. We may cancel a trip if the minimum number of
            participants is not reached, with at least 28 days' notice.</p>
        <p><strong>If we make a significant change or cancel, you may:</strong> Accept the changed arrangements or
            Purchase an alternative trip of similar standard from us, with any price difference refunded or additional
            cost payable. Compensation may be provided in certain circumstances, except for force majeure or minimum
            participant requirements.</p>
        <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>"Force majeure" includes events beyond our control such as war, terrorism, natural disasters, significant
            health risks, adverse weather, and similar events. We accept no liability or compensation for obligations
            affected by such events.</p>
        <h3>Our Liability</h3>
        <p>We ensure that trip arrangements are made with reasonable skill and care. We accept responsibility for any
            failure in service or personal injury caused by our negligence. We are not liable for issues resulting from
            your actions, third-party actions, or force majeure. Our liability for loss or damage is limited as
            specified, and we cannot accept liability for any loss not foreseeable or caused by factors beyond our
            control.</p>
        <h3>Delays</h3>
        <p>We cannot assist with delays at departure points. If flying with Rwandair or other airline carriers, you may
            be entitled to compensation from the airline. Costs associated with delays are your responsibility.</p>

        <p>Suppliers provide services according to their own terms, which may limit or exclude their liability.</p>
        <h3>Behavior and Damage</h3>
        <p>During your trip, follow instructions from our staff. We may terminate your trip without notice for behavior
            prejudicing the trip's success or safety. You are responsible for any damage or loss caused and must pay for
            repairs or replacements.</p>
        <h3>Passport and Visa Requirements</h3>
        <p>Check passport and visa requirements on our website and with relevant authorities. Ensure you have all
            necessary documents before departure. Costs for documentation are your responsibility.</p>

        </p>
